# Browsing Tracker
Web Extension that tracks all the browsing activity of the user and provides detailed report of how much time user has spent on the particular website


## Overview

The Student Browsing Tracker is a browser extension designed to help students, educators, and parents monitor and manage web browsing activity during study sessions. It tracks time spent on websites, categorizes them (e.g., educational, social media, entertainment), and provides insights to promote focused learning. The extension is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers, offering a lightweight and privacy-conscious solution for improving productivity.
## Features

- Time Tracking: Monitors time spent on each website during active browsing sessions.

- Category Insights: Automatically categorizes websites (e.g., "Educational" for sites like Khan Academy, "Distraction" for social media).

- Privacy First: Stores data locally by default, with optional cloud sync for authorized users.

- Cross-Browser Support: Works seamlessly on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
